# Operations Guide

Day-to-day tasks for managing the server after deployment.

---

## Checking Server Status

```bash
# SSH into either machine, then:
bash mc_status.sh
```

Shows: EC2 state, player list, TPS, RAM/CPU usage, last backup.

---

## Connecting to Machines via SSH

```bash
# Watcher (always on, always has a public IP)
ssh -i minecraft-key.pem ubuntu@<watcher_public_ip>

# MC Server (only has a public IP when running)
ssh -i minecraft-key.pem ubuntu@<mc_server_public_ip>
```

> Get current IPs: `terraform output` from the terraform/ directory, or from AWS Console → EC2 → Instances.

---

## Starting / Stopping the MC Server Manually

The server auto-starts when a player connects and auto-stops after 15 min of inactivity. For manual control:

**Start manually:**
```bash
# From AWS Console: EC2 → Instances → select minecraft-server → Start
# Or from any machine with AWS CLI:
aws ec2 start-instances \
  --region ap-east-1 \
  --instance-ids $(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=minecraft-server" \
    --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].InstanceId' \
    --output text)
```

**Stop manually (emergency):**
```bash
# SSH into MC server, then:
sudo systemctl stop minecraft
sudo /usr/local/bin/aws ec2 stop-instances \
  --region ap-east-1 \
  --instance-ids $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
```

---

## Sending Commands to the Server

Via RCON (from MC server SSH session):
```bash
mcrcon -H localhost -P 25575 -p YOUR_RCON_PASSWORD
```

Useful commands once in the RCON shell:
```
list          # show online players
tps           # show server performance (20 = perfect, <15 = lagging)
say Hello!    # broadcast message to all players
op playername # give operator to a player
kick playername # kick a player
ban playername  # ban a player
save-all      # force save world to disk
stop          # graceful shutdown
```

Exit RCON: `Ctrl+C`

---

## Viewing Server Logs

```bash
# Live log stream
sudo journalctl -u minecraft -f

# Last 100 lines
sudo journalctl -u minecraft -n 100

# Auto-stop log
tail -f /var/log/mc-autostop.log

# Backup log
tail -f /var/log/mc-backup.log

# mc-hibernation log (on Watcher)
sudo journalctl -u mc-hibernation -f
```

---

## Backups

### Automatic Backups
Backups run every 6 hours automatically. Files are stored in S3 as:
```
s3://YOUR_BUCKET/backups/mc-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.tar.gz
```
Files older than 30 days are automatically deleted.

### Manual Backup
```bash
# SSH into MC server
sudo bash /usr/local/bin/mc-backup.sh
```

### Restoring from Backup
```bash
# Copy script to MC server (from your local machine)
scp -i minecraft-key.pem scripts/mc_restore.sh ubuntu@<mc_ip>:~

# SSH in and run
ssh -i minecraft-key.pem ubuntu@<mc_ip>
sudo bash mc_restore.sh

# Or restore a specific backup:
sudo bash mc_restore.sh mc-backup-20240101-1200.tar.gz
```

The restore script creates a safety backup of the current world before overwriting it, saved to `/tmp/`.

### Listing Available Backups
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://YOUR_BUCKET/backups/ --region ap-east-1 | sort -r
```

## Updating PaperMC

```bash
# Copy script to MC server (from your local machine)
scp -i minecraft-key.pem scripts/mc_update_paper.sh ubuntu@<mc_ip>:~

# SSH in and run
ssh -i minecraft-key.pem ubuntu@<mc_ip>
sudo bash mc_update_paper.sh

# Or specify a version:
sudo bash mc_update_paper.sh 1.21.5
```

The script warns players 30 seconds before restarting.

---

## Adding / Updating Plugins

```bash
# SSH into MC server
cd /home/minecraft/server/plugins

# Download plugin jar
wget https://example.com/plugin.jar

# Reload plugins without full restart (if plugin supports it):
mcrcon -H localhost -P 25575 -p YOUR_RCON_PASSWORD "reload confirm"

# Or restart the server:
sudo systemctl restart minecraft
```

---

## Adjusting Auto-Stop Timer

Default: shuts down after 15 minutes of 0 players (3 checks × 5 min).

To change to 30 minutes (6 checks):
```bash
# SSH into MC server
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/mc-autostop.sh
# Change: if [ "$COUNT" -ge 3 ]; then
# To:     if [ "$COUNT" -ge 6 ]; then
```

---

## Adjusting Server RAM

Default: `-Xmx12G -Xms4G` (on t3.xlarge with 16 GB RAM).

To change:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service
# Edit the ExecStart line
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart minecraft
```

---

## Changing Instance Type

To upgrade/downgrade the MC server (e.g., switch from t3.xlarge to c6a.xlarge):

1. Edit `terraform/variables.tf`: change `mc_instance_type` default
2. Or edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars`: change `mc_instance_type`
3. Run `terraform apply`

Terraform will stop the instance, change its type, and restart it. World data is preserved (it's on the EBS volume, not the instance).

---

## DuckDNS IP Update

The Watcher updates DuckDNS every 5 minutes automatically. If players report they can't connect after the Watcher was briefly unavailable:

```bash
# SSH into Watcher
/opt/duckdns/update.sh
cat /opt/duckdns/duck.log  # should show "OK"
```

---

## Monitoring mc-hibernation (Watcher)

```bash
# SSH into Watcher
sudo systemctl status mc-hibernation
sudo journalctl -u mc-hibernation -f
```

If mc-hibernation crashes, it restarts automatically (Restart=always in systemd).

---

## Resizing the World Disk

If the 30 GB EBS volume gets full:

1. In AWS Console: EC2 → Volumes → select the MC server volume → Modify Volume → increase size
2. SSH into MC server:
```bash
sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1
df -h  # verify new size
```
No restart needed.
